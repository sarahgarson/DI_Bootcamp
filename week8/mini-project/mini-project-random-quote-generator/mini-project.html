    <!-- PART I: QUOTE GENERATOR-->

    <!--1. Create an HTML file, that contains a section (for now the section is empty), and a button “Generate Quote”.-->
    <section id="quote-display"></section>

    <button id="generate-btn">Generate Quote</button>

    <!-- PART II : ADD BUTTONS


   1.    In the HTML file, create a form with the inputs “Quote” and “Author” and a button. So when you click on the button, you can add a new quote to the array of object.
   
   Important: Don’t forget to set the id of the new quotes-->
    <p>- would you like to add a new quote to our list?</p>
    <form>
      <input type="text" id="quote-input" placeholder="Quote" />
      <input type="text" id="author-input" placeholder="Author" />
      <button id="add-btn">Add Quote</button>
    </form>

    <!-- 2. In the HTML file, under the displayed quote, create a few more buttons:

 a. A button that gives the number of character inside each quote (space included)
b. A button that gives the number of character inside each quote (space NOT included)
c. A button that gives the number of words in each quote
d. A button “Like” for the user to like a quote. Hint : add a new key to each object that will represent the number of “likes”.
-->

    <button id="character-count">Character Count (with spaces)</button>
    <button id="character-count-no-spaces">
      Character Count (without spaces)
    </button>
    <button id="word-count">Word Count</button>
    <button id="like-btn">Like</button>

    <!-- PART III: FILTER FORM
1. Create a form, that will filter the quotes depending on the name of the author. When the button of the form is clicked, display all the quotes from this specific author. 


2. Instead of showing all the quotes of the specific author. Show only one quote, and add a button “Previous” and a button “Next” that will display the next or previous quote.-->

    <p>- looking for something specific? try filtering by author!</p>

    <form id="filter-form">
      <input type="text" id="filter-input" placeholder="Filter by author" />
      <button id="filter-btn">Filter Quotes</button>
    </form>

    <button id="previous-btn">Previous</button>
    <button id="next-btn">Next</button>
