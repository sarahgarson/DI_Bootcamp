//üåü Exercise 1 : List Of People
//Instructions

const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];

// Part I - Review About Arrays

// 1. Write code to remove ‚ÄúGreg‚Äù from the people array.

let removeGreg = people.shift();
console.log(people);

// 2. Write code to replace ‚ÄúJames‚Äù to ‚ÄúJason‚Äù.

let replaceNames = people.splice(2, 1, "Jason");
console.log(people);

// 3. Write code to add your name to the end of the people array.

let myName = people.push("Sarah");
console.log(people);

// 4. Write code that console.logs Mary‚Äôs index. take a look at the indexOf method on Google.

let maryIndex = people.indexOf("Mary");
console.log(maryIndex);

// 5. Write code to make a copy of the people array using the slice method.

// a. The copy should NOT include ‚ÄúMary‚Äù or your name.

// Hint: remember that now the people array should look like this const people = ["Mary", "Devon", "Jason", "Yourname"];

// Hint: Check out the documentation for the slice method

let newArray = people.slice(1);
console.log(newArray);

// 6. Write code that gives the index of ‚ÄúFoo‚Äù. Why does it return -1 ?

let fooIndex = people.indexOf("Foo");
console.log(fooIndex);

// ANSWER : because it is not part of the array.

// 7. Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.

//Hint: What is the relationship between the index of the last element in the array and the length of the array?

let last = people.length - 1;
console.log(last);

//ANSWER : the last value will be the length of the array -1 since js counts the array length from 1 and the index is started with the number 0, so the last value of an array will always be the length -1.

// Part II - Loops

// 1. Using a loop, iterate through the people array and console.log each person.

for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
  console.log(people[i]);
}

// 2. Using a loop, iterate through the people array and exit the loop after you console.log ‚ÄúDevon‚Äù .

//Hint: take a look at the break statement in the lesson.

for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
  console.log(people[i]);
  if (people[i] === "Devon") {
    break;
  }
}

// üåü Exercise 2 : Your Favorite Colors

//Instructions

// 1. Create an array called colors where the value is a list of your five favorite colors.

let colors = ["Blue", "Brown", "Black", "White", "Green"];

// 2. Loop through the array and as you loop console.log a string like so: ‚ÄúMy #1 choice is blue‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy #2 choice is red‚Äù ect‚Ä¶ .

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  console.log(`My #${i + 1} choice is ${colors[i]}`);
}

// 3. Bonus: Change it to console.log ‚ÄúMy 1st choice‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy 2nd choice‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy 3rd choice‚Äù, picking the correct suffix for each number.

//Hint : create an array of suffixes to do the Bonus

let suffixes = ["st", "nd", "rd", "th", "th"];

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  let suffix = suffixes[i];
  console.log(`My ${i + 1}${suffix} choice is ${colors[i]}`);
}

// Exercise 3 : Repeat The Question

// Instructions

// 1. Prompt the user for a number.

//Hint : Check the data type you receive from the prompt (ie. Use the typeof method)

let number = prompt("Write a number! :)");

console.log(typeof number);

// While the number is smaller than 10 continue asking the user for a new number.

//Tip : Which while loop is more relevant for this situation?

while (number < 10) {
  number = prompt("Please enter a new number...");
  number = Number(number);
}
console.log("You entered a valid number!");

//Answer: if I didnt write previously the prompt value than a do while loop would be best so we can have shown at least once the 'Write a number! :)' message, but since we have already automatically asked for it at least once in the beginning  than theres no need for it to be a do while loop and we can use just a while loop to simplify.

// Exercise 4 : Building Management

// Instructions:

// Review About Objects

// 1. Copy and paste the above object to your Javascript file.

const building = {
  numberOfFloors: 4,
  numberOfAptByFloor: {
    firstFloor: 3,
    secondFloor: 4,
    thirdFloor: 9,
    fourthFloor: 2,
  },
  nameOfTenants: ["Sarah", "Dan", "David"],
  numberOfRoomsAndRent: {
    sarah: [3, 990],
    dan: [4, 1000],
    david: [1, 500],
  },
};

// 2. Console.log the number of floors in the building.

console.log(building.numberOfFloors);

// 3. Console.log how many apartments are on the floors 1 and 3.

console.log(
  building.numberOfAptByFloor.firstFloor,
  building.numberOfAptByFloor.thirdFloor
);

// 4. Console.log the name of the second tenant and the number of rooms he has in his apartment.

let secondTenant = building.nameOfTenants[1];
let numbRooms = building.numberOfRoomsAndRent[secondTenant.toLowerCase()][0];
console.log(secondTenant, numbRooms);

// 5. Check if the sum of Sarah‚Äôs and David‚Äôs rent is bigger than Dan‚Äôs rent. If it is, than increase Dan‚Äôs rent to 1200.

let calcSarahDavidRents =
  building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.sarah[1] +
  building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.david[1];

let danRent = building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[1];

if (calcSarahDavidRents > danRent) {
  building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[1] = 1200;
  console.log(building.numberOfRoomsAndRent.dan[1]);
}

// Exercise 5 : Family

// Instructions

// 1. Create an object called family with a few key value pairs.

let family = {
  mom: "Rachel",
  dad: "Douglas",
  sister: "Hannah",
  fish: "Racoon",
};

// 2. Using a for in loop, console.log the keys of the object.

for (let key in family) {
  console.log(key);
}

// 3. Using a for in loop, console.log the values of the object.

for (let key in family) {
  console.log(family[key]);
}

// Exercise 6 : Rudolf

// Instructions

const details = {
  my: "name",
  is: "Rudolf",
  the: "raindeer",
};

// 1. Given the object above and using a for loop, console.log ‚Äúmy name is Rudolf the raindeer‚Äù

let sentence = "";

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(details)) {
  sentence += ` ${key} ${value}`;
}

console.log(sentence.trim());

//This removes any trailing spaces from the final sentence.

//Exercise 7 : Secret Group

// Instructions

const names = ["Jack", "Philip", "Sarah", "Amanda", "Bernard", "Kyle"];

// 1. A group of friends have decided to start a secret society. The society‚Äôs name will be the first letter of each of their names sorted in alphabetical order.

//Hint: a string is an array of letters

let firstLetters = names.map((name) => name[0]);

firstLetters.sort();

let societysName = firstLetters.join("");

// 2. Console.log the name of their secret society. The output should be ‚ÄúABJKPS‚Äù

console.log(societysName);
