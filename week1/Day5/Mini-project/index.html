        Here you will fint the best and most famous pieces of art in history. We
        hope you can enjoy every single painting we provide and remember, Art is
        For All. Art is a diverse range of human activity and its resulting
        product that involves creative or imaginative talent generally
        expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or
        conceptual ideas.There is no generally agreed definition of what
        constitutes art,and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout
        history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three
        classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and
        architecture.Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as
        literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are
        included in a broader definition of the arts Until the 17th century, art
        referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts
        or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic
        considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and
        distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or
        applied arts.
